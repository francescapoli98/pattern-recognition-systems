<img src="https://apre.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/logo_uni-pisa.png" width="200" />

The couse is an introduction to the analysis and design of advanced machine learning and deep learning models for modern pattern recognition problems and discusses how to realize advanced applications exploiting computational intelligence techniques.

This repository stores the notebooks delivered for the midterms during the semester.
### Midterm 1
- **Assignment 3:** basic signal processing in audio files

Plotting the spectogram of samples of different instruments from [the english Philarmonia dataset](https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/sound-samples/) in order to  check if it is possible to recognize the different instruments by only looking at them. Developed using the [librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa) library.

### Midterm 2
-  **Assignment 1:** Hidden Markov Models and Viterbi algorithm for signal processing

Fitting and experimenting with an Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian emissions to the data in the [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction), and confront with the resulting time series of performing Viterbi on a reasonably sized subsequence.
