The couse is an introduction to the analysis and design of advanced machine learning and deep learning models for modern pattern recognition problems and discusses how to realize advanced applications exploiting computational intelligence techniques.

This repository stores the notebooks delivered for the midterms during the semester.
### Midterm 1
- **Assignment 3:** signal processing in audio files

Plotting the spectogram of samples of different instruments from [the english Philarmonia dataset](https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/sound-samples/) in order to  check if it is possible to recognize the different instruments by only looking at them. Developed using the [librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa) library.
